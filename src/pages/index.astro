    <h1>TypeDrifter</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm FranÃ§ois, a software engineer based in France who enjoys
      building things.
    </p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I work as a full-stack developer and occasionally take on DevOps roles,
      from designing scalable architectures to automating complex deployments. I
      really enjoy working remotly as it fit my lifestyle and allow me to
      express my full potential.

      <a href="/projects">projects page</a>.
    </span>
    <p>
      When I'm not in front of a computer, you will find me playing and
      tinkering with my guitars, trying to fix my car, or caring to my plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      I value privacy and data ownership, and I strongly dislike having my data
      or software locked away from my control.
